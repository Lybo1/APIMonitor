## 🌍 Overview

**API Monitor** is an intelligent, cross-platform system for scanning, analyzing, and protecting APIs and endpoints.  
It leverages a distributed, multi-language architecture with deep inspection capabilities—from OSI Layer 2 packet capture in C to high-level orchestration in Elixir.

Whether running as a desktop app or web backend, it’s designed to operate 24/7—flagging anomalies, analyzing traffic, and helping secure critical systems.

## 🚀 Key Features (Planned & In Progress)

- 📡 **API Scanning**
  - By URL, OpenAPI schema, Swagger, etc.
  - Local and remote API discovery

- 🕵️ **Real-Time Monitoring**
  - Endpoint behavior tracking
  - Intelligent anomaly alerts (planned)

- 🧠 **Custom AI-based IDS/IPS**
  - Built from scratch using real ML/AI, not wrappers
  - Learning-based traffic classification & threat detection

- 🧪 **Protocol-Level Inspection**
  - Down to **Layer 2** packet sniffing and analysis
  - Wireshark-grade depth built into the engine

- 🖥️ **Cross-Platform UI**
  - Web dashboard (Angular)
  - Native desktop UI via Qt (C++), Swift, Kotlin

## 🧱 Architecture Overview

### 🖥️ Frontend
| Language | Usage |
|=============================================================|
| **Angular + TypeScript** | Web dashboard                    |
| **Swift**                | macOS/iOS UI                     |
| **Kotlin**               | Android client                   |
| **C++**                  | Windows and Linux native clients |
|=============================================================|

### 🔙 Backend
| Language | Purpose |
|====================================================================|
| **C** | Raw packet inspection, Layer 2 (OSI) and above interface   |
| **C++ (Qt)** | Native desktop UI                                   |
| **C# (ASP.NET)** | Core backend, API layer                         |
| **Elixir** | Concurrency engine, pub/sub, protocol coordination    |
| **Julia** | Data modeling, statistics, anomaly detection (planned) |
|====================================================================|

## 🛠️ Getting Started

> ⚠️ This project is currently in early alpha. The setup process is under development and will be documented here as modules are added.

Planned install targets:
- CLI tools
- Desktop clients
- Docker support for backend services
- Extend backend with multiple Asp.Net APIs

---

## 📋 Roadmap & Development Status

### 🔧 Current / In Progress
- [x] ASP.NET Core backend skeleton
- [x] C-based low-level packet scanner (early version)
- [x] Basic project layout and repo setup
- [x] React frontend prototype (being deprecated)
- [ ] Replace frontend with Angular stack
- [ ] Establish modular backend structure (services, packet, AI, etc.)

### 🛠️ Near Future
- [ ] Elixir backend alongside Asp.Net for concurrency and messaging (Pub/Sub, workers)
- [ ] Angular UI + dashboard views (Live log, scan status, etc.)
- [ ] Swift UI for macOS and IOS
- [ ] Kotlin client for mobile monitoring
- [ ] Redis/Cassandra/MariaDB data layer integration
- [ ] Basic IDS/IPS rule engine
- [ ] Start modular plugin system for scanner types (URL, Swagger, OpenAPI)

### 🧠 Long-Term Vision
- [ ] Full AI-powered IDS/IPS system with learning capability
- [ ] OSI Layer 2+ traffic analysis from live wire/tap
- [ ] Visual protocol mapper (like Wireshark inside your UI)
- [ ] Distributed mode: multiple API-Monitor agents feeding a central brain
- [ ] User-defined detection rules via DSL (Elixir-based)
- [ ] Julia-powered data science module for threat prediction
- [ ] Public dashboard mode (Grafana-style threat display)
